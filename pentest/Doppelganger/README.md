# 🪞 Doppelganger – Mimic the Soul, Leave No Trace
Doppelganger is an arcane tool designed to mimic LSASS, extract its secrets, and hide them in plain sight. It builds upon the forbidden arts of HollowReaper, using hollowed processes, kernel exploits, and spectral clones to bypass protection and exfiltrate credentials with stealth.

## 📜 The Ritual
### 🩸 Doppelganger
The soul thief. This shellcode:

🛡️ Disables PPL using the cursed RTCore64.sys driver (BYOVD)

🧬 Clones LSASS into a benign replica

💾 Creates a Minidump from the clone

🗝️ XOR-encrypts the dump and writes it to disk, leaving behind only a shadow

### 🧿 Utilities
#### 💀 HollowReaper.c
The vessel for your payload. This performs process hollowing, carving out a legitimate process and injecting your shellcode into its husk.
🔧 Instructions for generating the shellcode to embed are provided in the HollowReaper project.

#### 🔐 decrypt_xor_dump.py
A local decryption utility. Use this to restore the original dump from its XOR-obfuscated form.

## ⚗️ The Components
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Doppelganger | The shellcode: disable PPL, clone LSASS, dump and XOR |
| HollowReaper.c |	Hollow a process and inject shellcode |
| decrypt_xor_dump.py | Python tool to decrypt XOR dump |
| RTCore64.sys | Vulnerable driver used for PPL bypass (BYOVD) |

## 🕯️ Usage Flow
### Standalone
In order to use Doppelganger you must place RTCore64.sys in C:\Users\Public. Doppleganger can be used standalone or hollowed through HollowReaper.
```
.\Doppelganger.exe
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Process Hollowed

1️⃣ Compile Doppelganger

2️⃣ Use Donut to convert it into shellcode
```
.\donut.exe -a 2 -f 7 -i Doppelganger.exe
```
3️⃣ XOR the shellcode and embed it into HollowReaper.c (look for util files in [HollowReaper](https://github.com/vari-sh/RedTeamGrimoire/tree/main/HollowReaper))

4️⃣ Run HollowReaper to hollow a process and trigger Doppelganger (all files saved to C:\Users\Public)
```
.\HollowReaper.exe "C:\windows\explorer.exe"
```
5️⃣ Use decrypt_xor_dump.py to decrypt the dumped file offline
```
python .\decrypt_xor_dump.py .\doppelganger.dmp
```
